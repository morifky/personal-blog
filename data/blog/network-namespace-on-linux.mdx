## Introduction

My personal learning note about network namespace concept on linux, one of the fundamental building blocks that powering software container technology nowadays.

## Glossary

**Namespace**: a feature of the Linux kernel that partitions kernel resources such that one set of processes sees one set of resources while another set of processes sees a different set of resources (wikipedia)

**Host**: In this article, host is a computer device that we use

## What is namespace onÂ linux?

In linux, there are 8 kinds on namespaces that available since kernel 5.6. I'll try to summarize 3 most popular namespace kind as follows:

1. **PID**: A process identifier, that happen on namespace level. It provides processes with independent PID from other namespaces.
2. **User ID**: Similar with PID above, this feature provides us to grant a granular access control for each running processes. For example, An user with limited access to process that running on namespace A, can't access any process on another namespaces.
3. **Network namespace**: provides an isolate networking stack (routing, IP address, etc) for each namespaces.

## Labs

Let's begin the labs work to explore the feature available on network namespace.

In this labs, we'll try to run a simple webserver inside a network namespace and make it accessible via host network.

1. Setup network namespace

First, let's create a new network namespace by execute these command:

```
~$ ip netns add <network-namespace-name>
```

In this case, i'll create new network namespace called `ns_rifky`

```
morifky@morifky-GF63-Thin-9RCX:~$ ip netns list

ns_rifky
```

Next, let's enabling the default loopback inside the created network namespace above

```
~$ ip netns exec ns_rifky ip link set dev lo up
```

2. Run web server

Next, we will try to run a simple webserver inside the network namespace we've create above.

The following command will create a simple webserver provided by python3 package.

```
~$ ip netns exec ns_rifky python3 -m http.server 4000
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 4000 (http://0.0.0.0:4000/) â€¦
```

Open a new tab in our terminal, and execute these command:

```
~$ sudo ip netns exec ns_rifky curl localhost:4000
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<html>
```

voila! we've successfully running and accessing the webserver hosted inside `ns_rifky` ðŸ¥³

3. Setup virtual ethernet and virtual IP addresses

So far we've successfully setup a webserver inside a dedicated `ns_rifky` network namespace and accessing it via its internal network.

However, we've got some trouble when try to access it via host network.

```
~$ curl localhost:4000
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 4000: Connection refused
```

let's do another steps to rectify this problem.

Our goals here is to make both host and the network namespace (`ns_rifky`) can communicate and talk to each other. So how to accomplish this goals? **meet virtual ethernet for the rescue.**

Imagine virtual ethernet is like a cable that can bridging the communication between host network and network namespace.

Here, we need to setup a pair of virtual ethernet; one will located inside host network, and the another end will located inside network namespace.

For this labs, we will create a pair of virtual ethernet

- veth_rifky

- veth_ns_rifky (peer)

```
~$ ip link add dev veth_rifky type veth peer name veth_ns_rifky
~$ ip link list
9: veth_ns_rifky@veth_rifky: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 16:27:5a:50:60:5b brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
10: veth_rifky@veth_ns_rifky: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 6e:f6:f3:3c:59:d5 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

Now, we need to change `veth_rifky` state from DOWN to UP

```
~$ ip link set dev veth_rifky up
```

we've successfully run `veth_rifky` inside the host network.

Next, we need to moved its peer -`veth_ns_rifky`- onto the network namespace `ns_rifky`

```
~$ sudo ip link set veth_ns_rifky netns ns_rifky
```

Don't forget to also change `veth_ns_rifky` state from DOWN to UP

```
~$ ip netns exec ns_rifky ip link set dev veth_ns_rifky up
```

Last, we need to add some "identifier" for both virtual ethernet.

This will make the packet can be routed to their destination properly.

For this labs we will use these address:

- ns_rifky = 10.0.0.10/24

- veth_ns_rifky = 10.0.0.11/24

```
~$ ip address add 10.0.0.10/24 dev veth_rifky
~$ ip netns exec ns_rifky ip address add 10.0.0.11/24 dev veth_ns_rifky
```

Now, we can try to re-accessing the webserver via host network, and here's the result

```
$ curl 10.0.0.11:4000

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">

<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Directory listing for /</title>
```

Congrats! we've finally make both host and our dedicated network namespace can communicate and talk to each other.
