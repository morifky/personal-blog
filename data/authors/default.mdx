Infrastructure engineer with over 5 years of experience designing, building, and maintaining scalable IT infrastructure on
AWS.

Mostly focused on making sure things run smoothly in the cloud — reliable, efficient, and not a pain to manage.

Big fan of solid infra and clean setups. I also drop some personal notes here from time to time — maybe they'll be useful to someone.
