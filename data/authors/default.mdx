I'm a Site Reliability Engineer with a strong focus on cloud infrastructure, automation, and system reliability. Over the past 5+ years, I’ve specialized in designing and operating scalable infrastructure — primarily on Amazon Web Services (AWS) — to support high-availability applications.

My core strength lies in building infrastructure systems that are reliable, observable, and easy to operate. I believe in treating infrastructure as code and automate everything from provisioning to deployment pipelines using tools like Terraform and modern CI/CD platforms.

While infrastructure is my main playground, I also had software engineering background. This gives me the flexibility to dive into application-level debugging and bridge the gap between development and operations.
